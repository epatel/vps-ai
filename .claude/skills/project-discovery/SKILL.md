name: project-discovery
description: Generate a compact architecture digest of an unfamiliar codebase via tree-sitter — entry points, hot internal API, per-file class/function map, external deps, orphan callables. Use when the user asks to explore, orient on, summarize, or get an overview of a repo, or when starting work on a project you haven't seen before. Supports Python, JS, TS, Go, Ruby, Rust, Java, C, C++.

# Project Discovery

Generate a markdown digest plus a YAML lookup index for any codebase, optimized for LLM project orientation.

## When to use

- The user asks: "what does this project do", "give me an overview", "summarize this repo", "explore this codebase", "what's the architecture".
- You're about to do non-trivial work in an unfamiliar repo and need to orient first.

## How to run

```bash
/Users/epatel/Development/claude/words-collector/venv/bin/python \
  /Users/epatel/Development/claude/words-collector/extract.py \
  <ROOT> \
  /tmp/wc-index.yaml \
  --symbols-only --internal-only \
  --summary /tmp/wc-summary.md
```

`<ROOT>` defaults to the current working directory if the user didn't specify a path.

## What you get

- `/tmp/wc-summary.md` (~2–10k tokens) — the digest. Read this and present its contents to the user.
- `/tmp/wc-index.yaml` — full per-symbol index keyed by name with `defined`/`called` lists. Use as a lookup table for follow-up "where is X defined / called" questions: grep, `yq`, or read directly.

## Summary sections

1. File count + language mix.
2. External dependencies (real third-party libraries, project-internal absolute imports excluded).
3. Entry points (`main`/`cli`/`run`/`start` defs + well-known filenames like `main.py`, `app.py`, `index.js`).
4. Hot internal API — top 20 most-called project-defined names.
5. Architecture — top 30 core (non-test) files, each with its classes and functions.
6. Test file count summary.
7. Orphan callable defs — defined but never called internally; usually framework-dispatched (migrations, route handlers, test cases).

## Notes

- Calls to externally-imported names are pruned in Python and JS/TS via per-file import resolution + receiver-root matching. Other languages match by bare name only.
- Name-based matching has no type inference: `local_var.foo()` where the project also defines `foo` will be counted as internal even if the receiver came from an external library. Treat hot-API counts as approximate.
- Re-run any time; ~5s for ~100k LOC.
